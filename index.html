        <h3>Biography</h3>

        <p>
          Hello, I'm Alade Oluwatimileyin Oluwapelumi, a student of
          <a href="https://www.altschoolafrica.com">Altschool Africa</a> I am
          currently studying Software engineering. My Student ID is
          <b>ALT/SOE/024/0359</b> and I am enrolled in the Frontend Track.
          <br />I am a recent graduate of Lagos State University (LASU), and a
          passionate UI/UX designer with a strong aspiration to become a
          frontend engineer. I have a deep enthusiasm for creating seamless user
          experiences and staying at the forefront of the tech industry. With
          over 2 years of experience, I've worked on various projects, from
          fintech applications to taxi booking services. <br />Currently, I'm
          focused on designing intuitive and engaging interfaces for
          Tech-Valley, a platform dedicated to revolutionizing the design
          industry.<br /><br />
          My expertise lies in UI/UX design, frontend development, content
          management systems, and creating responsive, user-friendly websites. I
          am proficient in tools like Figma, WordPress, HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript. One of my proudest achievements was leading the design
          team at a software development agency named Maseev Invisible Digitals.
          This role allowed me to significantly improve user satisfaction and
          engagement for the agency. Additionally, I redesigned the landing page
          for a taxi booking app, enhancing both customer support and user
          experience. When I'm not designing or coding, I enjoy playing football
          and also playing console games. I love exploring new technological
          trends too, especially fields like Cybersecurity, DevOps and Mobile
          application Development. I love spending time with family and friends
          too as we all know being alone makes one get tired of the
          uncertainties of life. I aim to continue growing as a frontend
          engineer and UI/UX designer, taking on new challenges and creating
          impactful digital experiences.

        <h3>Reason why I joined Altschool</h3>

        <p>
          I learned about AltSchool Africa from a post by Hack Sultan on X
          (formerly Twitter) that I saw in February 2022. Intrigued by the
          school, I followed up on the activities of the foundation. The purpose
          aligned with mine since I am interested in the tech industry and crave
          the advanced knowledge that AltSchool Africa promises. However, I
          could not take intentional steps regarding the school until this year
          when I took the entrance assessment test and passed. I joined
          AltSchool Africa because I am eager to take my skills and knowledge to
          the next level. AltSchool Africa is renowned for its rigorous and
          comprehensive tech bootcamp, which provides an immersive learning
          experience tailored to the needs of aspiring tech professionals. The
          opportunity to learn from industry experts and collaborate with
          like-minded peers is invaluable to me. AltSchool Africa’s focus on
          practical, hands-on training aligns perfectly with my learning style
          and career goals. I am excited about the chance to build a solid
          foundation in software engineering, enhance my problem-solving skills,
          and gain exposure to cutting-edge technologies. This bootcamp
          represents a crucial step in my journey towards becoming a
          well-rounded and highly skilled frontend engineer.
